# kobukis-

PIECES OF CODES
test_aligning : Make the kobuki turn by a definite deviation /
test_going back : Make the kobuki turn by a definite deviation and then translate by a definite distance/
test_orienting : Make the kobuki turn by a definite deviation, then translate by a definite distance, then rotate by deviation_2 /
test_random : perform the random motion /

combinaison : Final code (not finished) /


FUNCTIONS 
measure_angle : adjust the value of deviation to compensate the error when the kobuki rotates  /
printrandom(a,b,n) : print n integer randomly between a and b /
staterandom : choose a state randomly /
measure_distance / measure_distance negative : measures deplacement by the Kobuki /
sgn : return the sign of a float /
readtimer : read time /
virtualtimerstart : initialise and start the timer /
